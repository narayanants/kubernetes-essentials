Monolithic vs Microservices:
============================


Monolithic                                          Microservices
----------                                          --------------

Tightly coupled and run as single service           One service per process


Adding or removing features becomes complex         Each service performs one single function

Risk of app availability                            can be updated, deployed and scaled rapidly to meed demand



Where do all Microservices run?

    Physical Servers
    VM's
    Containers
