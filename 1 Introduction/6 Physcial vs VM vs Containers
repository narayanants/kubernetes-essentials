6 Physcial vs VM vs Containers:
===============================


Objectives:
============

    - Physcial Servers
    - Virtual Machines
    - Containers
    - VMs vs Containers


    Physcial Servers:
    ------------------

        - Metal Box
        - One software app on a Physcial Servers
    
            Application
            Operating System
            Physcial Servers

        Drawbacks:
        ----------

            - Procure Physcial Servers
            - Powering and Cooling
            - Overpriced

    Virtualiztion:
    ==============

        - VMware and Virtualiztion (XEN)
        - Multiple VMs on Single Machine
        - Consolidate apps into single Physcial Machine
        - Cost savings
        - Faster server provisioning

    Drawbacks:
    ==========

        - Requires compute and Storage
        - OS Licenses
        - RHEL is not for free
        - Costs 
        - Maintenance
        - Power and space


    Containers:
    ============

        - Containers virtualize at the OS level
        - Multiple containers run on a single OS
        - Light weight
        - Portable
        - Takes less resource
