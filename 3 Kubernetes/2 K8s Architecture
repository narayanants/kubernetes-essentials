K8s Architecture:
==================

    - Making K8s architecture Easy
    - High level overview
    - Kubernetes Master
    - Kubernetes Worker
    - Kubernetes Architecture
    - Terminology

High level overview:
--------------------

    - Worker nodes - VM's running in cloud
    - Compute, Storage resources to the apps

    - POD - Scheduling unit K8s
         - VM in Virtualization world
         - Consists of one or more containers
         - Containers reside inside POD

    - Container

        - run time environment for containerized apps
        - Reside inside pod
        - Designed to run microservices


    Master

        - Manage the whole cluster
        

In-depth Architecture:
----------------------

Master:
-------

        - Kubectl - interact with API Server
        - API Server - expose various APIs
        - Scheduler - Physcially Schedule PODS 
        - ectd - Distributed K:V store
        - Control Manager - Overall health of the Cluster


    - Managing the entire cluster
    Components of Master:

        - API Server (Exposes various API for various operation)
    
    How to interact with the API
    ----------------------------

        - Kubectl/UI => API => API Server

    Scheduler:
    ==========

        - Physcially scheduling pods across multiple nodes

    Control Manager:
    ================

        - overall health of entire cluster

        - Node
        - Replication
        - Endpoint
        - Service account and Token Controllers


    ectd:
    ======

        - Distributed K:V database
        - Central DB to store cluster state at any point of time


Worker:
=======

    - Kubelet
    - Kube Proxy


    Kubelet:
    --------

        - Node Agent that runs inside each K8s worker nodes
        - Looks in the Pods spec in the K8s master API Server and check whether the containers are running and healthy

    Kube Proxy:
    ===========

    * Maintain the entire network configuration of the nodes and pods and containers
    * exposes services to the outside world


    - POD - Scheduling unit in the K8s
    - Container - Each pod consists of one or more containers

    - Multiple dependant containers with PODS



Key Terminology:
================

     Kubernetes Master
     -----------------
    - API Server - Gateway to the Cluster. Interacts with Kubectl
    - Scheduler - Physically schedule PODS on the cluster
    - Control Manager - manage the overall health of the cluster
    - etcd - Distributed K:V DB that stores the current state of the cluster

    Kubernetes Worker:
    ------------------

    - Kubelet - Pods spec from API Server to maintain and deploy containers and their health
    - Kube-proxy - maintain the distributed network configuration
