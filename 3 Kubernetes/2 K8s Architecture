K8s Architecture:
==================

    - Making K8s architecture Easy
    - High level overview
    - Kubernetes Master
    - Kubernetes Worker
    - Kubernetes Architecture
    - Terminology

High level overview:
--------------------

    - Worker nodes - VM's running in cloud
    - Compute, Storage resources to the apps

    - POD - Scheduling unit K8s
         - VM in Virtualization world
         - Consists of one or more containers
         - Containers reside inside POD

    - Container

        - run time environment for containerized apps
        - Reside inside pod
        - Designed to run microservices


    Master

        - Manage the whole cluster
        

In-depth Architecture:
----------------------

Master:
-------

        - Kubectl - interact with API Server
        - API Server - expose various APIs
        - Scheduler - Physcially Schedule PODS 
        - ectd - Distributed K:V store
        - Control Manager - Overall health of the Cluster


    - Managing the entire cluster
    Components of Master:

        - API Server (Exposes various API for various operation)
    
    How to interact with the API
    ----------------------------

        - Kubectl/UI => API => API Server

    Scheduler:
    ==========

        - Physcially scheduling pods across multiple nodes

    Control Manager:
    ================

        - overall health of entire cluster

        - Node
        - Replication
        - Endpoint
        - Service account and Token Controllers


    ectd:
    ======

        - Distributed K:V database
        - Central DB to store cluster state at any point of time
